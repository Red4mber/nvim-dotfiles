# Neovim configuration

That's my neovim configuration, I separated it from the other dotfiles in [dotfiles](https://github.com/Red4mber/dotfiles) so that it's easier to install on machines where i don't want the rest of my configs.
I'll probably make it a flake eventually, but I just don't have time to work on that right now.
